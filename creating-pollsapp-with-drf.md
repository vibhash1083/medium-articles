# Creating pollsapp with Django REST Framework

Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architectural style which places a set of constraints. These constraints are being widely used for design and development of web services. In this article we will see how can we build simple RESTful services using Django and Django REST framework. Django is a very popular python based MVC framework used for fast development of monolithic applications. We will use [pollsapp](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/intro/tutorial01/) example from Django official documentation for our sample. This article assumes that readers have some basic idea of Django and RESTful web services. Later we will create UI for this application using ReactJs in part 2 and integration it with our Django based backend in part 3.
